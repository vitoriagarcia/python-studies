# Python studies

This serie of notebooks is a summary of Python core concepts and examples.

They main source I used to those is the [TechLake videos](https://www.youtube.com/@TRRaveendra), that teach Python focusing in Data Engineering.

Revisiting this material after working in the data field in a real company, I missed some more detailed explanations in some topics, so I added some content that I learned over time even gathered from posts (such as [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-variable-number-of-arguments-in-python-functions-d3a49a9b7db6) awesome Towards Data Science article about variable number of arguments in Python functions).
