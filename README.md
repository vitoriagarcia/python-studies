# Python studies

This series of notebooks is a summary of Python core concepts and examples.

They main source I used to those is the [TechLake videos](https://www.youtube.com/@TRRaveendra), that teach Python focusing in Data Engineering.

Revisiting this material after working in the data field in a real company, I missed some more detailed explanations in some topics, so I added some content that I learned over time even gathered from posts (such as [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-variable-number-of-arguments-in-python-functions-d3a49a9b7db6) awesome article about variable number of arguments in Python functions).

As I mentioned multiple times at the end of the notebooks, they just cover a small amount of what can be done with Python and were created to serve as one more source of knowledge for anyone that finds my GitHub account and wants to know what I think is important to be learned in the beginning of your Python journey to become a Data Engineer.

## Python sources:

There's <i>plenty</i> of amazing Python material around the internet, and here are some that I encourage you to check out:

- [Python official website](https://www.python.org/) - all the it's documentation is here, so consulting this is a must in a <i>pythonist</i> daily life
- [Programming for Everybody with Python](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage/course/programming-for-everybody-python) - this is a Python beginners course by University of Michigan and hosted in Coursera that requests almost no previous knowledge and takes only 12 hours (according to the platform)


### Bonus!
- [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) - this is an AWESOME source for knowing the state of the art in the data field. If you are a beginner, some content may look hard, but it's nice to start to get familiar with some concepts and techniques.

Feel free to contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitoria-garcia/) so we can talk about the data field!
