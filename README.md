# python-studies
A compilation of my Python studies from the past.

They main source I used to those is the [TechLake videos](https://www.youtube.com/@TRRaveendra), that teach Python with focus in Data Engineering.
Revisiting this material after working in the data field in a real company, I missed some more detailed explanation in some topics, so I added some content that I learned over time of even gathered from posts (such as [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-variable-number-of-arguments-in-python-functions-d3a49a9b7db6) awesome Towards Data Science article about variable number of arguments in Python functions).
